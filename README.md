## Learnings

1) Web Sockets
2) Client-Server Architecture
3) JDBC & SQLite
4) JavaFX


## TODO
1) Write tests
2) Perform user authentication and registration on server side (currently on client side)
3) Work on GUI


## Use Instructions

1) (Follow this step only if you are hosting server, otherwise directly start from step 2) Run `GameServer.java` file first, it will show output like following on console:
```bash
Server started on port: 5000
```
In case of error : change the port number in `GameServer.java` file, if port `5000` is busy.

2) Run `StartClient.java` class and give correct server port as input. (If port number not changed in step 1, then default server port is 5000).

3) After entering correct port number, Login window will appear. Initially you won't have login credentails, so register yourself by clicking on "Register" button.

4) After registration you will be in lobby. In the "PLAY WITH" list all online (on local network) players will be displayed. Click on players name, with whom you want to play.
